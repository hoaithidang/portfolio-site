     <h1>Add Me On Hulu</h1>
     <p>Imagine being able to watch your favorite content with your friends when you‚Äôre in Los Angeles and they are in San Francisco. </p>

     <h3>A Shared Love for TV</h3>
     <p>Whether you think about it or not, watching TV is a social experience. When you tune in to watch the latest episode of Game of Thrones on Sunday night, you know you are not alone. Your friends and coworkers are watching too. They might not be in the room physically with you but they‚Äôre there with you every step of the way.</p>
     <img src="0.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Feature">
     <p>You‚Äôre connected to your friends via Snapchat, Instagram, Messenger, and more. When the credits roll, you might go on Twitter or Reddit to see what strangers have to say about the cliffhanger season finale. On Monday morning, you‚Äôll have a conversation with your coworkers and buddies about what happened in the show just to relive the experience one more time.</p>

     <h3>Goals: Captivate and Connect</h3>
     <p>Hulu‚Äôs mission statement is to captivate and connect people with stories they love by creating amazing experiences. The people behind Hulu believe that TV is something people can bond over‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand it‚Äôs true.</p>

     <h3>Where Hulu Falls Short</h3>
     <p>Hulu is definitely captivating its audience with original content but it could do a better job at connecting viewers over the stories they love. We noticed that practically all streaming platforms (like Hulu, Netflix, and HBO) don‚Äôt provide users with social capabilities.</p>
     <img src="01.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Feature">

     <p>As two interns on the UX Design team, we brought this concept to life in just the span of two days. On the first day, we spent time researching and doing a competitive analysis of social community features on popular platforms like Instagram, SoundCloud and Spotify. Once we crafted a strong mission statement, we sketched wireframes, drafted user flows, made mockups and eventually a clickable prototype built using Principle. Thank you to the Hulu design team for your support and the amazing Tiffany Jiang for being a fantastic design partner!</p>

     <h3>Hackathon Prototype:</h3>
     <p>Our idea, ‚ÄúAdd Me on Hulu,‚Äù introduces social features to the platform that would allow Hulu users to engage as a social community around the content they love. Here is the final result that we presented at the Hackathon:</p>
     <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
       <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/227353956" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
     </div>

<p>You can view the prototype <a href="https://vimeo.com/230529400">here</a>. </p>

    <h3>Social Profiles on Hulu</h3>
    <p>To solve for this problem, we crafted this concept around Hulu Profiles and Rooms. Having profiles allow users to create a sense of identity within the larger Hulu ecosystem.</p>
    <img src="profile.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
    <p> This is an example of what a profile might look like on Hulu. You can follow friends and see what they‚Äôre watching in real time.</p>

    <h3>More Personalized Recommendations</h3>
    <p>Friends can follow other friends and strangers to see what they‚Äôre watching in real time, the way Spotify lets you see what friends are listening to. With friends on Hulu, you could get recommendations for what to watch next from your trusted friends who are the best sources.</p>

    <h3>Host a Watch Party</h3>
    <p>In addition, you could leverage these profiles to create viewing parties, a feature that allows Hulu users to watch content they love with their friends in real time. In these viewing parties, friends would be able to gasp, shriek, cry, and laugh at the very same moments.</p>

    <h3>Connect With Friends, Old and New</h3>
    <p>Imagine two strangers meeting at Comic-Con who bond over a shared love for Silicon Valley. They can now add each other on Hulu and deepen their relationship with just a follow. In essence, we aim to capture the spirit of real social viewing parties and put that to use through the Hulu experience.</p>

    <p>Scanning these custom QR codes would add that individual as a friend on Hulu. Similar to the Snapchat and Messenger codes experience.</p>

     <h1>Design Process:</h1>
     <h3>Mind Mapping</h3>
     <p> Together, we first did a mind mapping exercise to derive a holistic view of the Hulu platform and TV watching experience. Doing this helped us gain a better understanding of the relationship between our feelings, experiences, and ideas and how that relates to the topic at hand. One critical insight that we stumbled upon through this exercise is that watching TV is inherently a social experience crafted by communities. </p>

     <img src="1.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Mind Map">

     <h3>Content Communication</h3>
     <p> From there on, we examined the trends in how people communicate today about the content they watch. From sending snapchats to friends over the latest Game of Thrones release to reading fan theories on Reddit, people like to show their participation and appreciation in different ways. </p>
     <img src="2.jpeg" class="img-fluid" alt="Communication">

     <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
     <p> Following our communication affinity map, we looked for inspiration in terms of content engagement from other social media sites. We quickly drew up various social media UX based on our own usage. Our goal was to think about all the different ways in how users experience content socially.</p>
     <img src="3.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Interaction Models">
     <p> This exercise actually help pushed our design further because we were able to look beyond just thinking about TV. For example, we noticed how people love to put TV premiers on their Snapchat story. </p>
     <p>Our assumption is that they are creating a micro-community within stories themselves. Another interesting example was Spotify ‚ÄúFriend Activity‚Äù and how people can actively engage with music content directly when their friends are watching it. This led us to think about profiles: </p>

     <h3>Profiles</h3>
     <p>Profiles is the truly foundation for social identity and community. It allows us to create a sense of belonging within a larger community and to think about social aspects within the Hulu platform. </p>
     <img src="4.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Interaction Models">

    <h3>Our Solution in Lo-Fi:</h3>
     <p>This was our first stab at profile page. Our goal was to give users an identity beyond lineup recommendations. Some of our early ideas was having profile skins based on user‚Äôs favorite content. </p>
     <img src="5.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Profiles">
     <p>Our other idea was Watch Parties, a feature product that allowed users to watch the content they love with their friends in real time. From any TV show, users could set up a watch party and invite their friends, similar to a party invitation in real life. </p>
     <img src="6.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Profiles">
     <p>One of the challenges with watch parties was the introduction of ‚Äúfriends.‚Äù It adds a complex layer that was critical in order to get the experience right. We spent a lot of time discussing the tradeoffs of how to treat friends. </p>
